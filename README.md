# Advent_Of_Code_2024

This is my attempt at the Advent of Code 2024.
I'm using Python 3.12.

The inputs should be saved in the `inputs` folder, like this:

```
inputs
├── example_day1.txt
├── input_day1.txt
```

The `example_dayX.txt` files are the examples included in the problem statement.
The `input_dayX.txt` files are the inputs for the problems and should be kept private, therefore not included in the repo.

To run the code, use `python advent_of_code_2024_day_X.py`.

Some reusable functions are in `aoc_utils.py`.
